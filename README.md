# Awesome OSINT Obsidian

My collection of notes/links dedicated to [OSINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) and organized in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.

This is opinionated repo storing only content that I found useful for myself, but PRs and suggestions are welcome. Some of notes might be in russian.
